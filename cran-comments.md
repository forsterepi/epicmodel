## Resubmission
This is a resubmission of a new release. In this version I have:

* Replaced all occurrences of \dontrun{} in function documentation examples by 
  using if(interactive()){} or loading a file from inst/extdata

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes

* unable to verify current time

Note only appeared on my home computer. 
Checks with R-CMD-check GitHub Actions and win-builder service did not show it.

## revdepcheck results

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
